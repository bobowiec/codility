You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

	A[0] = 3
	A[1] = 1
	A[2] = 2
	A[3] = 3
	A[4] = 6

For the following elements:

A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
Write a function:

func Solution(A []int) []int

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

	A[0] = 3
	A[1] = 1
	A[2] = 2
	A[3] = 3
	A[4] = 6

the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

func CountNonDivisible(A []int) []int {
	N := len(A)

	counts := make(map[int]int)
	for _, v := range A {
		counts[v] += 1
	}

	nonDivisors := make([]int, len(A))
	cache := make(map[int]int)
	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		if v, ok := cache[A[i]]; ok {
			nonDivisors[i] = v
			continue
		}

		divisors := 0
		for j := 1; j*j <= A[i]; j++ {
			if A[i]%j == 0 {
				divisors += counts[j]
				if A[i]/j != j {
					divisors += counts[A[i]/j]
				}
			}
		}
		nonDivisors[i] = N - divisors
		cache[A[i]] = nonDivisors[i]
	}
	return nonDivisors
}
